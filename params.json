{"name":"Net-ucp","tagline":"Net::UCP - Perl extension for EMI - UCP Protocol. ","body":"\r\nThis module implements a Client Interface to the EMI - UCP Interface specification, This Protocol can be used to comunicate with an SMSC (Short Message Service Centre)\r\n\r\nUsually the Network connection is based on TCP/IP or X.25.\r\n\r\nYou will of course be required to have a valid login at the SMSC to use their services. (Unless there is an SMSC which provides their services for free. Please, let me know about any such service provider.) If you want to help my project send me info about some SMSC account.\r\n\r\nA Net::UCP object must be created with the new() constructor. Once this has been done, all commands are accessed via method calls on the object.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good know-how about EMI/UCP or if you have patience to read specification you can use this module in raw mode. See RAW MODE for more informations.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse Encode;   #you need it to convert text to GSM 03.38 Default Alphabet.
